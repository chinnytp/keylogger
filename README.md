# Keylogger
Windows Keylogger, inspired by/forked from [TheFox/Keylogger](https://github.com/thefox/keylogger). It saves the keys in a file whose name is the timestamp of when the program was started. To exit the program, one must perform the Konami Code (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → A B).

Note
====
Only for Windows!
